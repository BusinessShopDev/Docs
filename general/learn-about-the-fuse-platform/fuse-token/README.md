# BusinessShop Token (BSP)

The BSP token is the native currency of the BusinessShop blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## BSP utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the BusinessShop blockchain, BSP is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake BusinessShop to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.bspexplorer.com/](https://status.bspexplorer.com/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked BSP. Which means validators with higher amounts of BusinessShop staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any BSP holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of BSP they wish. They receive a share of the BusinessShop block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As BSP is the native currency on BusinessShop, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, BSP transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of BSP tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the BusinessShop platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;

At the moment, the BSP token is sometimes used by the project team to power liquidity rewards (yield farming) programs to boost liquidity on DEXes and the participation in the [BusinessShop Lending Network](./#fuse-utility).

The ongoing liquidity rewards programs on DEXes can be discovered [here](https://app.voltage.finance/index.html#/farm/154745).
